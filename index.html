                    What is food waste management?

                </h2>
                <p>The FAO defines food waste as. “…food appropriate for human consumption being discarded, whether it’s kept beyond its expiry date or left to spoil”.Food waste management relates to the stages of prevention, recovery, recycling, or food waste disposal that follows.

                    Stages of food waste management

                </h2>
                <p>The most important stage of food waste management is reducing the waste of edible food. Traditionally, tracking food waste hasn’t been a priority for commercial kitchens.

                    The majority simply don’t know  how much food they’re actually throwing away, and in turn how much money is wasted. Even if they do, most kitchens are limited to rudimentary food waste tracking spreadsheets, which take up valuable staff time and result in inaccurate data. This causes most businesses to vastly underestimate their food waste.

                <h2>What are the main causes of food waste?

                </h2>
                <p>Food is wasted for a variety of reasons, starting with the initial stages of the supply chain. Processing issues, overproduction, and unstable markets cause food waste before it even arrives at a commercial kitchen.</p>

                <h2>What are the benefits of food waste management?

                </h2>
                <p>There are three main benefits to managing food waste in kitchens; reduced cost, reduced environmental impact, and improved operational efficiency. Having a constant pulse on what is wasted throughout the day gives the kitchen teams more visibility, and ensures they can operate more sustainable and profitable kitchens.</p>
